💻 Replit Prompt: AI Crypto Arena (Revised Final)
TO: Frontend Developer FROM: Lead Frontend Architect PROJECT: Project B - Multi-Agent Trading Dashboard (Frontend) STACK: Next.js (React) + Tailwind CSS + Charting Library (e.g., Recharts)

I. ⚙️ ARCHITECTURAL SETUP (NO CHANGE)

Framework: Next.js.

Styling: Tailwind CSS.

Data Polling Logic: Poll for data every 3 seconds. Use NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable for real API connection; fallback to mock data if unset.

Initial View: The main view must be dominated by the Hero Chart. Default footer tab: Positions.

II. 🎨 VISUAL IDENTITY & STYLING RULES (UPDATED COLORS)

The UI must be Light/White-themed with high-contrast Black/Dark Grey text. Color is reserved solely for Agent/Strategy Identity and must be consistently applied across all components (charts, borders, card backgrounds).

A. Strategy Color Mapping (7 Unique Colors - Adjusted)

Strategy ID (Used in Data)	Color (Tailwind Suggestions)	Application Role
Grok_Comprehensive	Medium Red (red-700)	Core strategy color (Lighter than -900).
Grok_Pattern	Light Red (red-400)	Secondary strategy color.
Grok_Ichimoku	Black (gray-900)	Dedicated high-contrast color.
OpenAI_Comprehensive	Medium Green (green-700)	Core strategy color (Lighter than -900).
OpenAI_Pattern	Light Green (green-400)	Secondary strategy color.
Gemini_Comprehensive	Medium Blue (blue-700)	Core strategy color (Lighter than -900).
Gemini_Pattern	Light Blue (blue-400)	Secondary strategy color.
B. Component Styling Rules (CRITICAL)

Positions Table Rows: Use the strategy's color for a Colored Left Border (border-l-4 border-[color]) for visual identification.

Trade Rationale Cards: Implement the "Semi-Transparent Card with Solid Color Border" style for the narrative boxes, matching the high-quality look of the inspiration images.

III. 🖥️ LAYOUT & COMPONENTS SPECIFICATIONS (UPDATED TITLE & TABS)

1. Header (Scoreboard & Status)

Title: Change "Pro-Grade Dashboard" to AI Crypto Arena.

Metrics: Prominent display of Total Account Value and Aggregate PnL.

Status: Small, non-interactive chip: "Engine Status: Observation Mode."

2. Hero Zone (Equity Curve Chart - 60% Height)

Data: Plot the value over timestamp for all 7 distinct Strategy_ID lines.

Y-Axis: Must display Absolute Account Value (e.g., $10,000).

Legend: Clear, concise legend mapping each line color to its Strategy_ID.

3. Detail Zone (Footer Tabs - RENAMED)

Implement the following tabs:

Tab Name	Purpose	Data Source	Default Tab?
Positions	Real-time open trades/exposure.	Data Point 3	YES
Trade History	Audit trail of closed/completed trades (from Decision Log).	Derived from Data Point 4	NO
Trade Rationale	Narrative boxes of agent reasoning/signals.	Data Point 4	NO
Leaderboard	Performance ranking (sortable).	Data Point 5	NO
4. Asset Math Grid (Detail Component)

Functionality (CRITICAL): This must be a Per-Asset View. A user selects an asset (e.g., ETH/USDT), and the component displays the current Z-Score, Slope, and VWAP Dist from all 7 strategies that monitor that asset.

IV. 🔗 MOCK API DATA CONTRACT (NO CHANGE)

The mock data structure remains the same, ensuring all the necessary fields (strategyId, originalThesis, rationale, zScore, etc.) are present for the updated components.
